JADynamicTypeExampleInSwift
===========================

##Example Project
An example project is provided that requires IOS8 and XCode 7.0.
Developer and designers sometimes have a hard time visualizing the various dynamic type font styles available in IOS 7+. I've build this sample project to give a visual represenation of how these font styles look on labels, buttons, and within a view. Available for both iPhone and iPad. 

Play around and enjoy.
